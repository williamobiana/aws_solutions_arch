## EC2 Overview
Introducing ec2\
ec2 princing options

elastic compute cloud (ec2) is a secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud
* it is like a VM, only hosted in AWS instead of my own datacenter.
* it is designed to make web scale cloud computing easier for developers
* it gives you the capacity you want when you need it
* you are in complete control of your instances

AWS led a big change in the industry by introducing ec2 as a game changer\
ec2 changed the economics of computing by allowing us pay for what we use\
it allows us select the capacity we need, and grow or shrink when we need, there is no wasted capacity

on premise infrastructure has some disadvantages
* we always have to estimate capacity in our plans
* it requires long term investment of 3-5 years
* expectation that our application will grow into the capacity we bought
* there will be lots of wasted capacity, since we will not be using all of it.

the advantage of using ec2
* it takes minites to provision rather than months

ec2 princing options
* on demand: pay by the second/hour depending on the type of instance you run
* reserved: reserve capacity for 1 to 3 years. up to 72% discount on the hourly charge
* spot: purchase capacity at a discount of up to 90%. price flutuate with supply and demand
* dedicated: a pysical ec2 server dedicated for your use. the most expensive option.

on demand use-case
* flexible: low cost flexible ec2 without upfront payment or long term commitment
* short-term: apps with short-term spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interputed
* testing the water: apps developed or tested on aws ec2 for the first time 

reserved instance (RI) use-case
* predictable usage: apps with steady state or predictable usage
* specific capacity requirements: apps that require reserved capacity
* pay up front: we can make up-front payment to reduce the total computing costs even further
* standard RIs: up to 72% discount on-demand price
* convertible RIs: up to 54% discount on-demand price. has the option to change to a different RI type of equal or greater value
* scheduled RIs: launch within the time window you define. match our capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that requires a fraction of a day, week or month\
Reserved instance operate at a regional level

saving plans with reserved instances (RI)
* save up to 72%: all AWS compute usage, regardless of instance type or region
* commit to 1 to 3 years: commit to use a specific amount of compute power (measured by the hour) for 1 to 3 year period
* super flexible: not only ec2, this includes serverless technologies like lambda and fargate

spot instances use-case
* flexible: apps that have flexible start and end times
* cost sensitive: apps that are only feasible at low compute prices
* urgent capacity: for an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity\
examples: image rendering, genomic sequencing, algorithmic trading engines

dedicated hosts use-case
* compliance: regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
* licensing: great for licencing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployment
* on demand: can be purchased on demand (hourly)
* reserved: can be purchased for up to 70% off the on-demand price
to estimate the cost for AWS services, we can use a pricing calculator

### Exam tips
ec2 is like a VM, only hosted in AWS instead of my own datacenter\
it allows us select the capacity we need right now\
grow or shrink when we need, there is no wasted capacity\
we pay for what we use\
it takes minutes to provision, instead of months\
pricing models are:
* on demand: pay by the second/hour depending on the type of instance you run. Great for flexibilty
* reserved: reserve capacity for 1 to 3 years. up to 72% discount on the hourly charge. Great for fixed requirements
* spot: purchase capacity at a discount of up to 90%. price flutuate with supply and demand. Great for apps with flexible start-end time
* dedicated: a pysical ec2 server dedicated for your use. the most expensive option. Great for server-bound licences or compliance requirments


## AWS Command Line
launch an ec2 using console\
create an IAM user \
connect to ec2\
register the user with on CLI with ``aws configure``\
list out s3 bucket ``aws s3 ls``, make bucket ``aws s3 mb s3:\\bucketname``\
echo file and cp file to s3 bucket

### Exam tips
* Always give least privilage required to do the job
* Use groups (create groups with required policy permission and add users)
* Secret access key (password): if you lose it, you have to regenerate it again and run aws configure
* dont share keypairs (each dev should have thier own keypair)
* cli can be installed on local or used on an ec2


## Using Roles
what is an IAM role\
roles are temorary\
what else can roles do\

IAM role is an identity we can create in IAM that has specific permisisons.\
However instead of being uniquely associated with 1 person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

Roles are temporary, it doesnt have standard long term credentials that access keys and passwords do.\
it provides a temporary security credential for a role session.

What else can roles do?\
roles can be assumed by people, AWS resources, or other system level accounts\
roles can allow cross-account access, (one aws account can assume role of another another aws account to interact with its resources)

### Exam tips
* Roles are preffered from a security persperctive
* Roles allow you access without the use of access keys and secret access keys
* Policies control role permissions
* We can update policies attached to roles and it takes immediate effect
* We can attach and detach a role to a running ec2 without stoping or terminating it


## Security groups and bootstrap scripts
How computer communicate\
Security groups\
Bootstrap scripts\

How comupters communicate
* Linux: ssh port 22
* Windows: rdp port 3389
* http: web port 80
* https: encrypted web port 443

security groups
* security groups are virtual firewalls for our ec2
* by default everything is blocked
* to allow every ip address to have access 0.0.0.0/0,
* to communicate with our ec2 we open the approriate port for ssh/rdp/http/https

bootstrap scripts
* bootstrap scripts are scripts that runs when the instance first runs
* adding tasks at boot time adds to the amount of time it takes to boot the instance
* however, this allows us to automate the installation of applications

### Exam tips
* changes to security group takes effect immediately
* you can have any number of ec2 within a security group
* you can have multiple security group attached to ec2
* all inbound traffic is blocked by default
* all outbound traffic is allowed
* a bootstrap script is a script that runs when the ec2 first runs, it passes user data to the ec2 to install apps, dependencies, updates and more


## EC2 Metadata and User Data
what is ec2 metadata\
retriving metadata\
using user data to save metadata

ec2 metadata is data about our ec2 \
this can include information like private ip address, public ip address, hostname, security groups etc

retriving metadata
* using curl command in CLI, we can query metadata about our ec2
* curl http://``169.254.169.254``/latest/meta-data
* ``169.254.169.254`` is a magic ip for ec2 instances to retrieve userdata

using userdata to save our metadata
* using curl command and output to a txt file- in the user data script
* curl http://``169.254.169.254``/latest/meta-data/``data`` > file.txt

### Exam tips
* userdata is bootstrap scripts
* metadata is data about our ec2
* we can use bootstrap scripts (userdata) to access metadata


## Networking with EC2
diffrent virtual networking options\
ENI (elasctic network interface)\
EN (enhanced networking)\
ENA vs VF\
EFA

different virtual networking options
we can attach 3 diffrent types of virtual network cards to our ec2
* ENI (elastic network interface): basis day to day networking
* EN (enhanced networking): single root I/O virtualization SR-IOV to provide high performance
* EFA (elastic fabric adapter): accelerates high performance computing HPC and machine learning applications

ENI network card allows
* private ipv4 addresses
* public ipv4 address
* many ipv6 addresses
* mac address
* 1 or more security groups

ENI use-case
* create a management network
* use  network & security appliances on our VPC
* create dual-home instance with workloads/roles on distinct subnets (eg: mgt subnet 10.0.1.0, workload subnet 10.0.2.0)
* create a low budget, high avalaibility solution
an ec2 by default has an ENI attached to it.

EN network card
* for high performance networking between 10GBps - 100GBps
* it uses single root I/O vitualization SR-IOV to provide higher performance and lower cpu utilization
* provides a higher bandwidth, higher packet per second performance and consistently lower inter-instance latencies

ENA vs VF
* ENA (elastic network adapter): supports network speeds up to 100GBps for supported instance types
* VF (virtual function interface intel 82599) supports speeds up to 10GBps for supported instance types, (typically used or older instances)
always go for ENA, it is faster and mordern

EFA network card
* network device you attach to ec2 to accelerate high performance computing (HPC) and machine learning applications
* it provides lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than TCP transport traditionally used in cloud-based HPC systems

EFA OS-bypass
* EFA can use OS-bypass that makes it faster with much lower latency
* OS-bypass enables HPC and ML apps to bypass the OS kernel and communicate directly with the EFA device
* it is supported ONLY on Linux (not supported on windows)

### Exam tips
* ENI: basic networking, seperate management network from production network at a low cost, use multiple ENI for each network
* EN: when we need speed btw 10GBps - 100GBps for reliable high throughput
* EFA: when we need high performance computing and ML apps, when we need to do an OS-bypass.


## Optimizing with EC2 Placement Groups (Racks)
3 types of placement groups (racks where servers are kept)\
cluster\
spread\
partition

3 types of placement groups
* cluster
* spread
* partition

cluster placement groups
* grouping ec2 within 1 AZ
* recommended for apps that need low network latency(delay) and high network throughput(transmission) or both
* only certain ec2 types can be launched in a cluster placement group

spread placement group
* group of ec2 each placed on distinct underlying hardware
* recommended for apps with small number of ec2 that should be kept seperate from each other
* used for indiviual instances

partition palcement group
* each partition group has its own set of racks
* each rack has its own network and power source
* no 2 partition share the same rack, allowing to isolate impact of hardware failure within the app
* used for multiple instances

### Exam tips
* cluster: low network latency, high network throughput
* spread: indiviual critical ec2 instances
* partition: multiple ec2 instances, HDFS, HBase and Cassandra 
* cluster cant span multiple AZs, other can
* only certain ec2 types can be launched in a placement group (compute optimized, GPU, memory optimed, storage optimized)
* AWS recommends homogenous(same type) instance within cluster placement group
* we cant merge placement groups
* we can move or remove an exsisting instance into a placement group via CLI and SDK, we CANNOT do this via console.
* the instance must be in a stopped state before it can be moved


## Solving Licensing Issues with Dedicated Hosts
The diffrent pricing models for ec2\
dedicated hosts

recap pricing models are:
* on demand: pay by the second/hour depending on the type of instance you run. Great for flexibilty
* reserved: reserve capacity for 1 to 3 years. up to 72% discount on the hourly charge. Great for fixed requirements
* spot: purchase capacity at a discount of up to 90%. price flutuate with supply and demand. Great for apps with flexible start-end time
* dedicated: a pysical ec2 server dedicated for your use. the most expensive option. Great for server-bound licences or compliance requirments

recap dedicated hosts use-case
* compliance: regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
* licensing: great for licencing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployment
* on demand: can be purchased on demand (hourly)
* reserved: can be purchased for up to 70% off the on-demand price
to estimate the cost for AWS services, we can use a pricing calculator

### Exam tips
* special licensing requirment are for dedicated hosts
* dedicated hosts are physical server with ec2 dedicated to us
* dedicated hosts allows us to use our exisiting licenses per-socket, per-core and per-VM. including windows server, microsfor sql server SUSE linux enterprise server.



## Timing Workloads with spot instances and spot Fleets
what are ec2 spot instances\
spot prices\
spot blocks\
use case\
terminating spot instances\
what are spot fleets\
launch pools\
strategies

Spot instances allows us take advantage of unused ec2 capacity in the cloud\
Spot instances are available at up to 90% discount compared to on-demand prices

spot instances use-case
* flexible: apps that have flexible start and end times
* stateless apps
* fault tolerant apps\
examples: big data applications, containerized applications, CI/CD, high performance computing (HPC), test and development workloads
* cost sensitive: apps that are only feasible at low compute prices
* urgent capacity: for an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity\
examples: image rendering, genomic sequencing, algorithmic trading engines

spot prices
* to use spot instance, we must first decide on a max spot price, the instance will be provisioned as long as it is below our max spot price.
* the hourly spot price varies depending on capacity of AZ and region
* if spot price goes above maximum, we have 2 mintues to decide if we want to stop/terminate it

spot blocks
* we can use spot blocks to prevent our spot ec2 from terminating even if it goes about the max spot price.
* we can set spot blocks for 1-6hrs
* we can use the pricing history for more insights

use case\
spot instance are useful for the following:
* big data analytics
* containerized workloads
* CI/CD and testing
* image and media rendering
* high performance computing\
spot instance are NOT useful for the following because it can be terminated:
* persistent workloads
* critical jobs
* databases

terminating spot instance\
creating a spot request\
parameters:
* max price
* number of instances
* launch specs
* request type: ONE TIME/PERSISTENT

one time scenario:
* spot price goes above max price, instance is stopped

persistent scenario:
* spot price does go above max price, but we want to stop manually
* we manually cancel spot request, and manually stop the instance
* if we dont cancel the spot request, before manually stopping the instance, AWS will keep recreating a new instance

spot fleet
* collection of spot instances and optional on-demand instances
* spot fleet attempts to launch spot and on-demand ec2 to meet the target capacity we specified in the fleet request.
* spot instances is used if there is avaliable capacity and the current price is under our max price
* if our spot instance is interrupted, the fleet will try to maintain its target capacity.

launch pools\
fleet will try to match the target capacity with our price restraint
* set up diffrent launch pools and define ec2 type, OS, AZ etc.
* with our multiple pools, the fleet will choose the best way to implement depending on our defined strategy
* spot fleet will stop launching instances when it reach max price or desired capacity

strategies
* capacityOptimized: spot instance come from the pool with optimal capacity for the desired number of instances
* diversified: spot instance are distributed from all pools
* lowestPrice: spot instance come from pool with lowest price (this is the default strategy)
* instancePoolToUseCount: spot instance are distributed across the number of spot instance pool we specify (this is valid only when used in combination with lowestPrice)

### Exam tips
* spot instance save up to 90% of the cost of on-demand instances
* useful for computing where we dont need persistent storage
* we can stop spot instance from terminating using a spot block
* spot fleet is a collection of spot instances and optionally on-demand instances



## Deploying vCenter in AWS with VMware Cloud on AWS
why use VMware\
use-cases\
deployment

VMware is used by organizations for private cloud deployment, some organizations use hybrid cloud strategy (VMware + AWS)

Use-cases
* hybrid cloud (on premise + AWS)
* cloud migration (migrating on prem to AWS using VMware tools)
* disaster recovery (disaster recovery environment on AWS)
* leveraging AWS services that are not avaliabe on prem

deployment
* it runs on dedicated hardware hosted in AWS in a single account
* each host has 2 sockets with 18 cores per socket, 512 GiB RAM, and 15.2 TB Raw SSD storage
* each host is capable of running multiple VMware instances (up to the hundreds)
* cluster can start with 2 hosts up to a maximum of 16 hosts per cluster

### Exam tips
* we can deploy vCenter on AWS using VMware
* perfect solution for extenting private cloud to AWS



## Extending AWS beyond the cloud with AWS outposts
what is outposts\
benefits\
family members\
process

What is outposts
* brings AWS data center to on premise
* we can have outpost of 1U, 2U to 42U rack servers with multiple rack deployments

benefits
* Hybrid cloud (having aws services on prem)
* fully managed infrastructure (AWS manages it for us)
* consistency (AWS console, APIs and SDKs in our hybrid environment)
